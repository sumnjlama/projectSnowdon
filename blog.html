                <h2>The Story:</h2>
                <br>
                <p> In 2018, I climbed Snowdon in Snowdonia, Wales. Snowdon is the highest mountain in Wales towering at
                    1,085 metre. It is also one of the most popular landmarks in the UK and has many visitors who trek
                    to its peak every year.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Walkers can take different trails to reach the peak. We chose the Miners track, which took us roughly
                    2-3 hrs to reach the top. The temperature started to drop as we approached the pinnacle of the track
                    but the sight of the surrounding grew more beautiful. The vastness of the environment grew bigger
                    the higher we climbed. We overcame the extremely steep and sometimes slippery climb up to the peak
                    and we were rewarded with more stunning views. My experience at the top was tremendously cold and
                    foggy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The fog at the top of the mountain made the visibility of the surroundings below the mountain
                    extremely hard to see, but after hours of climbing the steep trek I was simply glad to reach the end
                    of the trail. I was in awe due to the sheer scale of the mountain but I was at its peak.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>The Pictures:</h2> <br>
                <p>I wanted to capture the vast scale of the mountain and I did so by juxtaposing the hikers with the
                    environment. The photos give you a perspective of how I was seeing the environment at that time, its
                    vastness in contrast to the miniscule beings captured my imagination. The day wasn't the best for
                    photography but I was glad to have experienced the mountain and its surroundings.
